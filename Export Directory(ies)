-----Explaination-----

If you want to grab a list of folders or files, or both, in a directory you can do that with the below commands.
This could be used for auditing content or auditing permissions.

-----Grab Folders Only-----

set-location "\\share\directory"
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | ?{$_.PSIsContainer} | Select-Object FullName | Export-Csv "\\Client\Export.csv"

-----Grab Files and Folders-----

set-location "\\share\directory"
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | ?{$_.Fullname} | Select-Object FullName | Export-Csv "\\Client\Export.csv"

-----end-----
