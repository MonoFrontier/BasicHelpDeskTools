-----Explaination-----

#This should only be used if sub folders or sub items: 
1. parent permissions were not inherited, even if inheritance is enabled
2. if sub directories do not have unique permissions

-----Guide-----

# This is for insurance, tell PowerShell that you want to work in the directory <path> you want to modify
Set-Location "<path>"

#Then grab a collection of all subfolder/items under the directory <path>
$folders = Get-ChildItem "<Path>"

foreach ($subfolder in $folders){
    
    $folder = $subfolder.name

#Set the permissions to be applied
#Run the change across all subfolder/items

    $NTFSPermissions = Get-Acl "<path>" 
        #Specify the permissions you want to assign to sub folders/items
        $accessrule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule("$permission","Modify","Allow")

        $NTFSPermissions.SetAccessRule($accessrule)

        $NTFSPermissions | Set-Acl $folder

        }

-----End-----
